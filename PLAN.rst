===================
Implementation Plan
===================

Basic:

* REST API for listing existing Admin projects with permissions
* ReactJS front-end listing projects with permissions
* API endpoint returning logged-in user information
* Reflect logged-in user information in front-end
* List API View generation for the model
* React model view, auto-generated from the admin classes

Authentication:

* Login/logout/password-change API
* Login/logout/password-change in front-end

Recent actions:

* Recent actions API
* Recent actions front-end 

Long-term ideas:

* Pluggable front-end model generators
* Serializers/views generator (needed?)
